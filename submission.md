## Description

Windows-Touch is a touchscreen that you can download to your laptop. With about $.3 or Rs 20(India) of
hardware paired with our fancy computer vision algorithms, you can turn any
laptop screen into a touchscreen.

You can click links or draw pictures or play the piano on your screen!

## Project Information

### Technologies

Software: Python, OpenCV, gotten from project Sistine(https://github.com/bijection/sistine).

Hardware: Cardboard, mirror shards, tape. (No animals were harmed while making this project.)

### Presentation Details

I am presenting on a Windows Pc, customized with $.3 or Rs 20 worth of hand-built hardware.
This is a hack that's most effectively presented on the Windows screen itself,
not a projector. 

### The Why?

The project Sistine did not include support for windows. High end users won't anyways buy 1 dollar hack because this is temporary. But those people who want to buy a laptop and / or have an ancient laptop with camera can experience Computer Vision and touch experience.
The goal is to inspire such  projects and contributions to open source.
