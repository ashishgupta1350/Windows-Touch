## Public URL: https://youtu.be/1SrF__brJMo

## Description

Sistine is a touchscreen that you can download to your laptop. With about $1 of
hardware paired with our fancy computer vision algorithms, you can turn any
laptop screen into a touchscreen.

You can click links or draw pictures or play the piano on your screen!

(Your grandma can finally click the screen with her finger.)

## Project Information

### Technologies

Software: Python, OpenCV, all hand-written detector code.

Hardware: Paper plates, mirror shards, hot glue, angle brackets, a door hinge,
and a Leatherman. (We burned our fingers a nonzero number of times in the making
of this hack.)

### Presentation Details

We're presenting on a MacBook, customized with $1 worth of hand-built hardware.
This is a hack that's most effectively presented on the MacBook screen itself,
not a projector. We do want a projector to show a video, though.
